# Missing Functionality Analysis

## Overview

After conducting a comprehensive review of the official Claude Code documentation, we've identified several major systems and features that are missing from our clean implementation. This document outlines the gaps and their importance.

## Critical Missing Systems

### 1. Comprehensive Hooks System ❌

**Current State**: Basic process lifecycle hooks only
**Missing**: Complete hooks system with multiple event types

**What's Missing**:
- **Hook Events**: PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, Notification, Stop, SubagentStop, PreCompact, SessionStart
- **Configuration**: JSON-based hook configuration in settings files
- **Shell Integration**: Arbitrary shell command execution with timeout management
- **Tool Matching**: Pattern-based tool filtering for hooks
- **Environment Variables**: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR and other hook-specific variables
- **Blocking Capabilities**: Ability for hooks to prevent tool execution

**Impact**: HIGH - Hooks provide core extensibility and automation capabilities

### 2. Sub-agents System ❌

**Current State**: Not implemented
**Missing**: Complete sub-agent functionality

**What's Missing**:
- **Agent Definition**: Markdown files with YAML frontmatter configuration  
- **Directory Structure**: `.claude/agents/` and `~/.claude/agents/` support
- **Specialized Prompts**: Custom system prompts for different agent types
- **Tool Scoping**: Agent-specific tool access control
- **Automatic Delegation**: Intelligent task routing to appropriate agents
- **Context Management**: Separate context windows for agents

**Impact**: HIGH - Sub-agents provide specialized AI assistance and workflow optimization

### 3. Slash Commands System ❌

**Current State**: Not implemented
**Missing**: Interactive command system

**What's Missing**:
- **Built-in Commands**: `/help`, `/clear`, `/model`, `/add-dir`, `/review`, `/status`, `/login`
- **Custom Commands**: User-defined commands via Markdown files
- **Directory Structure**: `.claude/commands/` support for project-level commands
- **Arguments**: Dynamic argument handling with `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder
- **Bash Execution**: Command execution capabilities
- **MCP Integration**: Dynamic slash commands from MCP servers

**Impact**: HIGH - Slash commands provide interactive session control and customization

### 4. Enhanced Settings System ⚠️ 

**Current State**: Basic configuration management
**Missing**: Hierarchical settings with advanced features

**What's Missing**:
- **Settings Hierarchy**: Enterprise → CLI → Local → Shared → User precedence
- **Environment Variables**: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK, etc.
- **Hooks Configuration**: JSON-based hooks configuration in settings
- **Permission Policies**: Advanced permission management
- **Status Line Configuration**: Customizable context display
- **Enterprise Management**: Managed settings for organizations

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Current system works but lacks advanced configuration capabilities

### 5. Advanced MCP Integration ⚠️

**Current State**: Basic MCP structure
**Missing**: Complete MCP feature set

**What's Missing**:
- **Scope-based Configuration**: Local, Project, User scope separation
- **Remote Server Types**: SSE and HTTP server support (we only have stdio)
- **Authentication Flow**: `/mcp` slash command for remote server auth
- **Server Management**: Enhanced `mcp list`, `mcp get`, `mcp remove` commands
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Automatic MCP slash command generation
- **Security Validation**: Server verification and security warnings

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Basic MCP works but missing advanced server management

### 6. GitHub Actions Integration ❌

**Current State**: Not implemented
**Missing**: Complete GitHub integration

**What's Missing**:
- **GitHub App**: Installation and repository integration
- **Workflow Automation**: PR creation and bug fixing workflows
- **Issue Integration**: @claude mentions in issues and PRs  
- **CI/CD Integration**: AWS Bedrock and Google Vertex AI support
- **Security Management**: GitHub Secrets integration
- **CLAUDE.md Support**: Project standards integration

**Impact**: LOW - Nice-to-have for automated workflows but not core functionality

## Functional Features We Have ✅

### Working Systems
1. **Basic CLI Structure**: Commands, options, help system ✅
2. **Interactive Sessions**: Print mode and interactive mode ✅
3. **Configuration Management**: Basic config get/set/list ✅
4. **Authentication**: Token validation and management ✅
5. **Basic MCP**: Stdio server support ✅
6. **Process Hooks**: Basic process lifecycle management ✅
7. **Session Management**: Basic session persistence ✅
8. **Error Handling**: Proper exit codes and error messages ✅

## Impact Assessment

### Critical Gaps (Need Implementation)
1. **Hooks System** - Core extensibility platform
2. **Sub-agents** - Specialized AI assistance  
3. **Slash Commands** - Interactive session control

### Important Gaps (Should Implement)
1. **Enhanced Settings** - Advanced configuration
2. **Complete MCP** - Full server management

### Optional Gaps (Nice-to-Have)
1. **GitHub Actions** - Automation workflows

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Interactivity
1. Implement basic slash commands (`/help`, `/clear`, `/model`)
2. Enhance hooks system with PreToolUse/PostToolUse events
3. Add UserPromptSubmit hooks for better session management

### Phase 2: Advanced Features  
1. Implement sub-agents system
2. Complete hooks system with all event types
3. Enhance MCP with scope-based configuration

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Integration
1. Custom slash commands
2. GitHub Actions integration
3. Enterprise settings management

## Conclusion

Our clean implementation covers approximately **60-70%** of Claude Code's functionality. The core CLI, configuration, and MCP basics work well, but we're missing key systems that provide extensibility and advanced workflows. The hooks system, sub-agents, and slash commands represent the largest functionality gaps that significantly impact the user experience.

The missing functionality explains why our validation tests were hanging and why certain workflow patterns might not work as expected. Implementing the hooks system should be the immediate priority to ensure proper process lifecycle management.
